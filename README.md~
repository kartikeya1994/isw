Fix:
- upcoming failure at Machine JobExecutor
- Do something about MA population size. It should vary with problem size. But have an upper bound. (Needs testing)
- MaintenanceThread check TODO: Problem with labour reservation while planning
- JobExecutor release PM labour jobType not PM instead of JobStatus
